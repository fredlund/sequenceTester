  The sequenceTester library is a Java library
  used for writing and testing unit tests
  for a possibly non-sequential APIs, i.e.,
  were calls may block. The library has been used to test
  exercises in the undergraduate
course "Concurrencia" at the Escuela Tecnica Superior
  de Ingenieros Informaticos at the Un
  iversidad Politecnica de Madrid, Spain.
</p>
<p>
  The main idea is to write test cases as sequences of API calls,
  and to provide excellent diagnostics of why a test case failed, i.e.,
  showing a complete trace of the calls of a failed test case, and
  indicating clearly the reason for failure. For example, that the call
  is blocked although it should have been unblocked by a call,
  or that it returned an incorrect value.

<h1>Unit Tests</h1>
<p>
A unit test is an instance of the 
{@link es.upm.babel.sequenceTester.TestStmt} interface. A test statement is either:
<dl>
  <dt>{@link es.upm.babel.sequenceTester.Nil}</dt>
  <dd>A test statement which always succeeds.</dd>

  <dt>{@link es.upm.babel.sequenceTester.Prefix}(TestCall call, TestStatement stmt)</dt>
  <dd>A test statement
  which first executes the TestCall call, and if that succeeds, then
  continues with succeeding statement.</dd>
  <dt>{@link es.upm.babel.sequenceTester.Branches}(Call[] calls, Alternative... alternatives)</dt>
  <dd>
  A branch statement can handle nondeterminism in the tested
  program. First the calls are executed in parallel then
  the alternatives are checked to see if any of them can explain the
  result of executing the parallel calls. The alternatives are checked
  sequentially, from left (earlier in the array) to the right.
  An alternative describes which calls unblocked, with optional oracles attached.
  For an alternative to match
  the execution result,
  the unblocked calls must be accepted by the alternative unblock specification.
  An alternative has a
  continuation statement which is used to continue the test.
  </dd>
</dl>
</p>
<h1>Calls</h1>
<p>
  An instance of the {@link es.upm.babel.sequenceTester.Call} class is a
  <b>recipe for making
  a call</b>, and an <b>oracle which decides if the invocation of
    the call returned the correct result</b> (or raised the correct exception).
  A call may be given
  a symbolic name, which is useful to specify that it is later
  (during the execution of another call) unblocked.
  Note that a Call instance extends the Tryer class of the cclib library.
</p>
<h1>TestCalls</h1>
<p>
  An instance of the {@link es.upm.babel.sequenceTester.TestCall} class
  executes a set of calls in parallel, and <b>checks that
  the correct calls are <em>blocked</em> and <em>unblocked</em></b>.
  The TestCall has a constructor
    {@code
TestCall(Call[] calls, Unblocks unblocks)
   }.
  The calls are executed in parallel, and unblocks specifies which calls <em>must</em> or <em>may</em> unblock.
  </p>

  <h1>Oracles</h1>
  Oracles checks the return values, or exceptions, of terminated calls.
  Oracles are instances of the {@link es.upm.babel.sequenceTester.Oracle}
  interface.
  
<h1>Unblocks</h1>
<p>
  An unblock instance specifies which calls <em>must</em> or <em>may</em> unblock,
  and has a constructor
    {@code
  public Unblocks(Map<String,Oracle> mustUnblock, Map<String,Oracle> mayUnblock)
   }.
  The maps associated the symbolic name of a call with an optional oracle (the oracle may be null).
  Note that oracles can be associated directly with calls and/or with an
  unblock specification.
  </p>

  <h1>An Example</h1>
<p>
  Suppose we have an API with three methods: set(int),
  dec(), and whenZero() such that set(int) sets the value of a counter
  to the argument and always unblocks immediately,
  dec() decrements the value of the
  counter by 1 and always unblocks immediately, whereas
  a call to whenZero() unblocks when the value of the counter becomes 0.
</p>
<p>An example unit test for this API may then be:
  <pre>
{@code
Prefix
(TestCall.unblocks(new Set(3)),
 Prefix
 (TestCall.unblocks(new Dec()),
  Prefix
  (TestCall.blocks(new WhenZero().n("whenZero")),
   Prefix
   (TestCall.unblocks(new Dec()),
    Prefix
    (TestCall.unblocks(new Dec(),"whenZero"),
     Nil)))))
}
  </pre>
  Given constructors Set(int), Dec() and WhenZero() which creates
  instances of a Call (sub)class,
  the test expresses that if we first set the counter to 3
  (a call which immediately returns, i.e., "unblocks"),
  and then decrement the counter
  (a call which immediately returns),
  and if we next call whenZero() that call blocks (does not return).
  Note that we give the call to whenZero() the symbolic name "whenZero",
  by calling the method name (or n), with the symbolic name as an argument.
  If next we decrement the counter again that call immediately
  returns. Finally if we again call dec() again
  then both that call returned immediately, <b>and</b>
  also the earlier call to whenZero() returned ("unblocked").
</p>
<p>Using the library API we can write this unit more compactly as a sequence:
<pre>
{@code
TestCall.unblocks(new Set(3)),
TestCall.unblocks(new Dec()),
TestCall.blocks(new WhenZero().n("whenZero")),
TestCall.unblocks(new Dec()),
TestCall.unblocks(new Dec(), "whenZero")
}
</pre>
</p>  
<p>
  Suppose next we modify the dec() method to return the value
  of the counter after the decrement operation,
  and that we wish to check that value in the unit test,
  i.e., defining oracles. This can be done using the code:
<pre>
{@code
TestCall.unblocks(new Set(3)),
TestCall.unblocks(new Dec().o(Check.returns(2))),
TestCall.blocks(new WhenZero().n("whenZero")),
TestCall.unblocks(new Dec().o(Check.returns(1))),
TestCall.unblocks(new Dec().o(Check.returns(0)), "whenZero")
}
</pre>
The specification of the decrement operation, e.g.,
new Dec().o(Check.returns(2)),
associates an oracle (using the method oracle or o)
to the method call. The oracle is Check.returns(2),
which specifies that the call returns normally with the value 2.
The {@link es.upm.babel.sequenceTester.Check} class
contains a number of convient oracles; it is also possible
to define a custom oracle.
</p>
<h2>Subclassing Call</h2>
<p>Next we consider what is needed to write a subclass for the
  Call class; we examine the Dec call as an example:
  <pre>
    {@code
public class Dec extends CounterCall {
  private Object returnValue;

  Dec() { setUser("dec"); }

  // Executes the call
  public void toTry() { returnValue = controller.dec();  }

  // Returns the return value
  public Object returnValue() { return returnValue;  }

  // Prints the call
  public String toString() { return "dec()"; }
}
    }
  </pre>
<p>
  All such subclasses should define toTry which executes the call
  and toString which is used to pretty print counterexamples.
  If a call returns a value, such as Dec, then the returnValue method
  should be defined too.
  </p>
<p>
  </p>
In fact the Dec class does not subclass Call directly, but CounterCall, which
provides access to the controller object -- a convenient mechanism
for passing an object to several such subclasses of Call which implement
object methods:
  <pre>
    {@code
public abstract class CounterCall extends Call {
  Counter controller;

  public CounterCall() { }

  public void setController(Object controller) {
    if (controller instanceof Counter)
      this.controller = (Counter) controller;
    else
      throw new RuntimeException();
  }
}
    }
    </pre>
</p>
<h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
<p>
  To retrieve the return value of a call given its symbolic name
  use the method {@link es.upm.babel.sequenceTester.Call#returnValue(String)}.</p>
<p>
  How do we check if a call is blocking? A call is deemed blocking if it has not returned after
  some specified small time interval.
  The default can be changed by calling the {@link es.upm.babel.sequenceTester.Call#waitTime(int)} method.
</p>
<p>
  Want to write an oracle that is parametric on the return value of its call?
  If so use the {@link es.upm.babel.sequenceTester.Check#lambda(java.util.function.Predicate<Object>)} method.
    An example: suppose that we have a call {@code IsEven(int n)} that returns true
    if n is even. Then we can write make a call and check its return value in the following way:
    {@code new IsEven(n).oracle(Check.lambda(x -> (x % 2) == 0))}.
</p>
<p>
  If we want to use previous return values in subsequent calls
  or oracles of subsequent calls this is easy to achieve. Consider
  for instance an operation {@code Rand()} that returns a random
  integer, and an operation {@code IsEven(n)} that checks whether is
  parameter is even. We can check such an API using the test case:
  <pre>
{@code
TestCall.unblocks(new Rand().n("rand")),
TestCall.unblocks(new Lambda
                  (() ->
                     {
                       Integer rndInt = (Integer) Call.returnValue("rand");
                       return new IsEven(rndInt).oracle(Check.returns((rndInt % 2) == 0));
                     }))
}
</pre>
Note that we postpone the creation of the IsEven call using
  the {@link es.upm.babel.sequenceTester.Lambda} call subclass.
