  The sequenceTester library is a Java library
  used for writing and testing unit tests
  for a possibly non-sequential APIs, i.e.,
  were calls may block. The library has been used to test
  exercises in the undergraduate
course "Concurrencia" at the Escuela Tecnica Superior
  de Ingenieros Informaticos at the Un
  iversidad Politecnica de Madrid, Spain.

  The main idea is to write test cases as sequences of API calls,
  and to provide excellent diagnostics of why a test case failed, i.e.,
  showing a complete trace of the calls of a failed test case, and
  indicating clearly the reason for failure. For example, that the call
  is blocked although it should have been unblocked by a call,
  or that it returned an incorrect value.
