TOOD list
=========

- Check that UnitTest tests have unique names.

- cclib:

Provide a method in Tryer to check whether a call has started -- boolean started().

- Make call numbering less fragile.

- Clean up documentation.

- Use a getter/setter style uniformly.

- Implement sequentialization test.

- Get rid of the controller (it is not type-checked at just not very nice).

- Add a Lambda test statement, and get rid of the lambda test call.

- Controller handling:
  instead of a separate argument for controller we keep a test state
  which can be modified by a call.
  A call belongs to a UnitTest, so we can find the state. And set the state.

- Get rid of configurationDescription also, and move it to a setter.
