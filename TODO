TOOD list
=========

- Check that UnitTest tests have unique names.

- cclib:

Provide a method in Tryer to check whether a call has started -- boolean started().

- Make call numbering less fragile.

- Clean up documentation.

- Use a getter/setter style uniformly.

- A way to specify a default timeout value for a test.

- Randomize the ordering of starting commands in a parallel tests,
and maybe introduce some random delays too

- Maybe by default re-run parallel commands a number of times,
or rather, provide a syntax for repeating them (with good diagnostics).
(an option).
