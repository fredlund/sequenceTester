TOOD list
=========

- Clean up documentation.

- Use a getter/setter style uniformly.

- Implement sequentialization test.

- Bad test error message: for a call with deterministic unblocking results, report ALL calls that were not unblocked. It seems that currently (alertar_4, TestCall.unblocks(new Transferir("cuenta_0","cuenta_1",10).w(500),"t_1_2","t_2_3","alertar_2","alertar_1","alertar_0")) we only report only non-unblocked call.
